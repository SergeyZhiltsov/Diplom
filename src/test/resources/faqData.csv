If they believe that you should be considered, you will be asked to schedule an appointment at the doctor’s office (or clinic) for further evaluations.

California law also requires us to keep the recording for two years after the conversation date. The audio recording will be kept in a secure location and will not be shared without your permission except if required by law."
